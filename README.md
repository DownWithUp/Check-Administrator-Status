# Check-Administrator-Status
A spin off of Command Prompt Add-ons. This includes examples of how to check privilege status.
Please Note: These programs derive outcomes based on their execution. If one of these programs is RAN as an administrator, then the output will be as such. These programs are not dependent on IF the user is an administrator, but rather if they were ran with administrative rights.
